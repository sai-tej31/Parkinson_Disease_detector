The data in the datasets is in the form of:

Dataset is delimited as CSV values as follows;

X ; Y; Z; Pressure; GripAngle; Timestamp; Test ID

----------------
Test ID: 
0: Static Spiral Test ( Draw on the given spiral pattern)
1: Dynamic Spiral Test ( Spiral pattern will blink in a certain time, so subjects need to continue on their draw)
2: Circular Motion Test (Subjectd draw circles around the red point)

We have studied the data for long time and listed out the main features which are PRESSURE,GRIPANGLE,TIMESTAMP and STATE(DYNAMIC OR STATIC based on the test),
and also we are going to work more on this project and list few more features based on the X,Y,Z which we have an idea for now.
